//! Cross-batch query accumulation for single-pass classification.
//!
//! `run_log_ratio`'s `DeferredDenomBuffer` (`src/commands/helpers/deferred_denom.rs`)
//! established the pattern this module generalizes: accumulate reads as flat COO
//! `(minimizer, packed_read_id)` entries across many input batches, then drain into
//! one sorted `QueryInvertedIndex` for a single index scan. The reason to flatten
//! immediately rather than hold `Vec<(Vec<u64>, Vec<u64>)>` per read (as
//! `QueryInvertedIndex::build` does) is residency: holding both the raw per-read
//! minimizer vectors AND the flattened, sorted entries at once roughly doubles peak
//! memory for no benefit. `QueryAccumulator::push` drops each read's vectors the
//! moment they are flattened, so only one representation is ever resident.
//!
//! Generic over `M`, the per-read metadata payload, so both callers can share this
//! type: the CLI carries `String` headers (for `format_classification_results`,
//! which indexes output rows by position), and the Arrow/C-API path carries `i64`
//! query ids.
